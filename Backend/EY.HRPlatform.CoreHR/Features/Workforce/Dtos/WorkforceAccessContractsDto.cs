/// orchestration returns to the browser. CoreHR owns the canonical Employee facts and
/// obtains the non-disclosing account-state outcome from Identity over the signed
/// internal contract (<c>internal/identity/workforce-access/candidates</c>), then joins
/// them here. The browser therefore never joins untrusted Identity and CoreHR facts
/// itself, and a command never carries a forgeable Employee identity fact — only an
/// Employee reference, the reviewed baseline choice, and an optimistic-concurrency
/// token. CoreHR re-resolves the canonical subject and Identity rechecks state at
/// commit; a previously returned candidate is guidance, never authority.
///
/// The account-state vocabulary mirrors Identity's
/// <c>WorkforceAccountCandidateOutcome</c> exactly and is carried as a stable string,
/// matching the established roster projection pattern. Account or tenant identifiers
/// from another workspace are never returned.
