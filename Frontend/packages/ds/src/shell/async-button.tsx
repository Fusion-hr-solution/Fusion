/**
 * Fusion's convention for a control that starts an ordinary asynchronous action.
 *
 * While the request is in flight the control shows one centred progress
 * indicator and nothing else, at unchanged size and position. Only this control
 * is disabled; the surface around it does not move, and there is no page-level
 * overlay.
 *
 * Two details are easy to get wrong on their own, which is why they live here:
 *
 * - the label keeps its space while hidden. Removing it outright collapses the
 *   button to the spinner's width, so a row of actions reflows around it;
 * - the label is not replaced by progressive wording. `Saving…` beside a
 *   spinner says the same thing twice, and a label that changes length moves
 *   everything after it.
 *
 * The accessible name survives the swap through `aria-label`, and `aria-busy`
 * reports the state, so the control does not go quiet while it works.
